# HD for HQ

A small project to try and bring HQ Trivia's Android version up to par with its iOS counterpart.

## Scope of the project

HD for HQ is not a cheat tool. HD for HQ will never add features that Intermedia Labs themselves would not implement.

### HQ Trivia

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in-Px_sOQdE @ 3:30 - 3:45 && 3:55 - 4:00
  - Fade-in & translation for every word of the question 
  - Transition answers in (fade & translate)
  - Animate user count and HQ logo (is the heart icon still there?)
  - Video should appear as a small bubble during questions.
  - Play sound when tapping answer
  - Fancy "Time's up!"/"Correct" animation

- Friend avatars don't show anymore on their tapped answers. TODO: find reference video
- Enable text correction on chat input box
